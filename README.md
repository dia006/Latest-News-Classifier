# Project forked from  miguelfzafra

Mostly I am interested in the exercise to show how a real ML project can reach production.

Usually everyone is interested in the central part of this pipeline but it seems the other elements are the one more time consuming. So I analyzed the pipelined stated by miguelfzafra and changed accordingly to my taste.

The project consists of the following steps:

1. [Dataset Creation](https://github.com/dia006/Latest-News-Classifier/tree/master/0.%20Latest%20News%20Classifier/01.%20Dataset%20Creation)
2. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/dia006/Latest-News-Classifier/tree/master/0.%20Latest%20News%20Classifier/02.%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis)
3. [Feature Engineering](https://github.com/dia006/Latest-News-Classifier/tree/master/0.%20Latest%20News%20Classifier/03.%20Feature%20Engineering)
4. [Model Training](https://github.com/dia006/Latest-News-Classifier/tree/master/0.%20Latest%20News%20Classifier/04.%20Model%20Training)
5. [News Scraping](https://github.com/dia006/Latest-News-Classifier/tree/master/0.%20Latest%20News%20Classifier/05.%20News%20Scraping)
6. [App Creation](https://github.com/dia006/Latest-News-Classifier/tree/master/0.%20Latest%20News%20Classifier/06.%20App%20Creation)
7. [Annex - Installation](https://github.com/dia006/Latest-News-Classifier/tree/master/0.%20Latest%20News%20Classifier/07.%20Annex%20-%20Installation)
8. [Annex - Deployment](https://github.com/dia006/Latest-News-Classifier/tree/master/0.%20Latest%20News%20Classifier/08.%20Annex%20-%20Deployment)
9. [Report](https://github.com/dia006/Latest-News-Classifier/tree/master/0.%20Latest%20News%20Classifier/09.%20Report)
10. [App Creation v2](https://github.com/dia006/Latest-News-Classifier/tree/master/0.%20Latest%20News%20Classifier/10.%20App%20Creation%20v2) (*I created a new version of the application after submitting the project.)

NB - Project started -> 2020/04/25
